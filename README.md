## Description

This is a collection of [Taskwarrior
hooks](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/hooks_guide.html) that I use in my
day-to-day workflows. It comes along a detection and easy-registration mechanism
that should make it easy to develop and then distribute your own hooks. The
hooks are structured as classes under the `tw_hooks/hooks` directory.

## Installation

Install it from `PyPI`:

```sh
pip3 install --user --upgrade tw_hooks
```

To get the latest version install directly from source:

```sh
pip3 install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/bergercookie/tw-hooks
```

After the installation, you have to run the `install-hooks-shims` executable
(which by this point should be in your `$PATH`). Running it will create shims
(thin wrapper scripts) under `~/.task/hooks` in order to register all the hooks
with Taskwarrior.

## Available hooks

Currently the following hooks are available out-of-the-box:

<table style="undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 823px">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Hook</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Events</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>AutoTagBasedOnTags</tt></td>
    <td>Inspect the list of tags in the added/modified tasks provided and add additional tags if required</td>
    <td><tt>on-modify</tt>, <tt>on-add</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>CorrectTagNames</tt></td>
    <td>Change tag names based on a predefined lookup table</td>
    <td><tt>on-modify</tt>, <tt>on-add</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>DetectMutuallyExclusiveTags</tt></td>
    <td>See whether the user has specified an incompatible combination of tags</td>
    <td><tt>on-modify</tt>, <tt>on-add</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>PostLatestStartToI3Status</tt></td>
    <td>When a task is started, send the title of the task to i3status-rs via DBus</td>
    <td><tt>on-modify</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>WarnOnTaskCongestion</tt></td>
    <td>Warn the user if there are too many tasks (due:today)</td>
    <td><tt>on-exit</tt></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Structure of a Hook

The purpose of this package is to facilitate the development and distribution of
Taskwarrior hooks. To this purpose `install-hooks-shims` allows you to easily
register your own hooks, without having to manually copy items over to the
taskwarrior hooks location. `install-hooks-shims` will install a shim which will
call your hook automatically when required.

This is an example of a Taskwarrior hook that will be executed on Taskwarrior
exit:

```python
from tw_hooks import OnExitHook
class WarnOnTaskCongestion(OnExitHook):
    """Warn the user if there are too many tasks."""
    def _on_exit(self, _):  # <--- Mandatory to implement this signature
      # ...
      return 0
```

Assuming that this hook is in a module called `warn_on_task_congestion.py` and
that the directory of this module is in your python path (e.g., by adding it
explicitly to `$PYTHONPATH`), then you can run the following to register your
hook with taskwarrior:

```sh
install-hooks-shims -r warn_on_task_congestion
```

During your next Taskwarrior operation, if there are too many due:today tasks,
you should see something like this:

```sh
t add +test kalimera
Created task 719.
[WarnOnTaskCongestion] Too many due:today tasks [threshold=9]
```

## Hooks API

Subclass one of the following base hooks, and your method is going to be called
during that event:

- [`OnAddHook`](https://github.com/bergercookie/tw-hooks/blob/master/tw_hooks/base_hooks/on_add_hook.py)
  - Implement the `_on_add(self, added_task: TaskT)` method.
- [`OnExitHook`](https://github.com/bergercookie/tw-hooks/blob/master/tw_hooks/base_hooks/on_exit_hook.py)
  - Implement the `_on_exit(self, added_modified_tasks: List[TaskT])` method.
- [`OnLaunchHook`](https://github.com/bergercookie/tw-hooks/blob/master/tw_hooks/base_hooks/on_launch_hook.py)
  - Implement the `_on_launch(self)` method.
- [`OnModifyHook`](https://github.com/bergercookie/tw-hooks/blob/master/tw_hooks/base_hooks/on_modify_hook.py)
  - Implement the `_on_modify(self, original_task: TaskT, modified_task: TaskT)`
    method.

## Usage instructions for `install-hooks-shims`

<!-- START sniff-and-replace install-hook-shims --help START -->

```python
usage: Detect Taskwarrior hooks and register an executable shim for each one of them.
       [-h] [-t TASK_DIR] [-a] [-l]
       [-r REGISTER_ADDITIONAL [REGISTER_ADDITIONAL ...]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TASK_DIR, --task-dir TASK_DIR
                        Path to the taskwarrior main directory
  -a, --all-hooks       Install shims for all the hooks
  -l, --list-hooks      List the available hooks and exit
  -r REGISTER_ADDITIONAL [REGISTER_ADDITIONAL ...], --register-additional REGISTER_ADDITIONAL [REGISTER_ADDITIONAL ...]

Usage examples:
===============

- Install only the WarnOnTaskCongestion hook
  install-hook-shims -r tw_hooks.hooks.warn_on_task_congestion

- Install a custom hook defined in .../dir/mod/hook_name.py. "dir" should be in your PYTHONPATH
  install-hook-shims -r mod.hook_name

- List all the available hooks and exit
  install-hook-shims --list-hooks

```

## FAQ

- Why should I use this over raw taskwarrior hooks?
  - Because this package does the heavy lifting pre-processing the input tasks
    from the command line. It does so in a robust manner making sure it does
    the right thing regardless of weather one or two commands are provided and
    being robust to errors (e.g., `utf-8` decoding errors).
  - It gives you a class-oriented approach and lets you install multiple hooks
    from the same class, thus allowing these hooks to share common
    configuration.
  - It also allows you to keep all your hooks together and keep
    them as a package in some other place in your filesystem, e.g., in your
    dotfiles and automatically adds the right glue-code so that Taskwarrior your
    scripts without having to explicitly place it in `~/.task/hooks` or
    symlinking it.
